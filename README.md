# Chat-GPT Insights
ChatGPT Insights is a Firefox add-on allowing you to analyse and extract insights from your ChatGPT conversations, revealing how ChatGPT arrives at its answers.

The tool allows you to export locally the relevant data as CSV. More work is needed to improve the CSV export functionality, but it does work.

This is but a Firefox port of the [ChatGPT Path Chrome extension from Ayima](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/chatgpt-path/kiopibcjdnlpamdcdcnphaajccobkban?authuser=0&hl=en), so all credit goes to them.

Known limitations

* it doesn't work well with Firefox Multi-Account Containers.
